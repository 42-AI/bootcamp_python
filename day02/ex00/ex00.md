Implement the higher order functions `map()`, `filter()` and `reduce()`. Take the time to understand the use cases of these three built-in functions.

How they should be prototyped:

```py
def ft_map(function_to_apply, list_of_inputs):
    pass

def ft_filter(function_to_apply, list_of_inputs):
    pass

def ft_reduce(function_to_apply, list_of_inputs):
    pass
```
