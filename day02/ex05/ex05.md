Write a class named `TinyStatistician` which implements the following methods.   
All methods take in a NumPy array and return a new modified one.  
We are assuming that all inputs are correct, i.e. you don't have to protect your functions against input errors.

* `mean(x)` : computes the mean of a given non-empty numpy.ndarray `x`, using a for-loop and returns the mean as a float, otherwise None if `x` is an empty numpy.ndarray. This method should not raise any Exception.

* `median(x)` : 

* `quartiles()` : 

* `variance(x)` : computes the variance of a given non-empty numpy.ndarray `x`, using a for-loop and returns the variance as a float, otherwise None if `x` is an empty numpy.ndarray. This method should not raise any Exception.

* `std(x)` : computes the standard deviation of a given non-empty numpy.ndarray `x`, using a for-loop and returns the standard deviation as a float, otherwise None if `x` is an empty numpy.ndarray. This method should not raise any Exception.


**Examples**
```python
>>> from TinyStatistician import TinyStatistician

```
