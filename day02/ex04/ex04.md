You have create a package called `ai42`.  
I will have 2 functionalities: 
* the progress bar (day00 ex10), that can be imported via `import ai42.progressbar`,
* the logger (day02 ex02) `import ai42.logging.log`,  
You may have to rename the functions and change the architecture of the package.

The package will be installed via pip using the follwing command :  
`bash build.sh && pip install ./dist/ai42-1.0.0.tar.gz`  

The build.sh script has to create the `ai42-1.0.0.tar.gz` file.  

To check if the package you can run the command `pip list`.  
If the package is properly installed you may see it listed via this command.
