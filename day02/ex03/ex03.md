# Exercise 03 - Json issues

|                         |                    |
| -----------------------:| ------------------ |
|   Turnin directory :    |  ex00              |
|   Files to turn in :    |  json_reader.py    |
|   Forbidden function :  |  json, eval        |
|   Remarks :             |  n/a               |

It's the context manager that will help you to handle this task.

Implement a `Loadjson` class that open, read, and parse a json file, store it in a data attribute as a nested dict, and close the file at the end of the usage.
you will also have to code the function `print_formated`.

```bash
>> cat list.json
{"quiz":{"sport":{"q1":{"question": "Which one is correct team name in NBA?","options": ["New York Bulls","Los Angeles Kings","Golden State Warriros","Huston Rocket"],"answer": "Huston Rocket"}},"maths": {"q1": {"question": "5 + 7 = ?","options": ["10","11","12","13"],"answer": "12"},"q2": {"question": "12 - 8 = ?","options": ["1","2","3","4"],"answer": "4"}}}}
```

tester.py
```py
from json_reader import loadjson, print_formated

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with Loadjson('list.json') as js:
        data = js.getdata()
        print_formated(data)
```

Output
```bash
>> python tester.py
"quiz": {
    "sport": {
        "q1": {
            "question": "Which one is correct team name in NBA?",
            "options": [
                "New York Bulls",
                "Los Angeles Kings",
                "Golden State Warriros",
                "Huston Rocket"
            ],
            "answer": "Huston Rocket"
        }
    },
    "maths": {
        "q1": {
            "question": "5 + 7 = ?",
            "options": [
                "10",
                "11",
                "12",
                "13"
            ],
            "answer": "12"
        },
        "q2": {
            "question": "12 - 8 = ?",
            "options": [
                "1",
                "2",
                "3",
                "4"
            ],
            "answer": "4"
        }
    }
}
```
