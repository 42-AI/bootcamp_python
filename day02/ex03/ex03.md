|   Remarks :             |  Context Manager   |

It's the context manager that will help you handle this task.

Implement a `CsvReader` class that opens, reads, and parses a csv file.
In order to create a context manager the class will need a few built-in methods: `__init__`, `__enter__` and `__exit__`.
It's mandatory to close the file at the end of the procedure.

```py
class CsvReader():
    def __init__(self, sep=',', header=False, skip_top=0, skip_bottom=0):
        pass
```

Usually the separator in csv files is the `,`, but we want to be able to change this parameter.
You can also tell the class to skip lines at the top and the bottom, and also to keep the first line as a header if `header` is `True`.

The file shouldn't be corrupted (line with too many elements), if it's corrupted return None.
You have to handle the case `file not found`.

You will have to also implement 2 methods: `getdata()` and `getheader()`

```py
from csvreader import CsvReader

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with CsvReader('good.csv') as file:
        data = file.getdata()
        header = file.getheader()
```

```py
from csvreader import CsvReader

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with CsvReader('bad.csv') as file:
        if file == None:
            print("File is corrupted")
```
