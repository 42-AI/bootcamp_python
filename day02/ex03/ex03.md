|   Remarks:              |  Context Manager   |

The context manager will help you handle this task.

Implement a `CsvReader` class that opens, reads, and parses a CSV file.  
In order to create a context manager, your class will require a few built-in methods: `__init__`, `__enter__` and `__exit__`.  
It's mandatory to close the file once the process has completed.

```py
class CsvReader():
    def __init__(self, filename=None, sep=',', header=False, skip_top=0, skip_bottom=0):
        pass
```

Short for Comma-Separated Values, a CSV file is a delimited text file which uses a comma to separate values. Therefore, the field separator (or delimiter) is usually a comma `,`, but we aim to be able to change this parameter.  
You can make the class skip lines at the top and the bottom of the file, and also keep the first line as a header if `header` is `True`.

The file shouldn't be corrupted (either a line with too many values or a line with too few values), otherwise return `None`.
You have to handle the case `file not found`.

You will have to also implement two methods: `getdata()` and `getheader()`

```py
from csvreader import CsvReader

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with CsvReader('good.csv') as file:
        data = file.getdata()
        header = file.getheader()
```

```py
from csvreader import CsvReader

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with CsvReader('bad.csv') as file:
        if file == None:
            print("File is corrupted")
```
