|   Turnin directory :    |  ex03              |
|   Files to turn in :    |  csvreader.py      |
|   Forbidden function :  |  None              |
|   Remarks :             |  Context Manager   |

It's the context manager that will help you to handle this task.

Implement a `CsvReader` class that open, read, and parse a csv file.
In order to create a context manager the class will need few builtin methods: `__init__`, `__enter__` and `__exit__`.
It's mandatory to close the file at the end of the procedure.

```py
class CsvReader():
    def __init__(self, sep=',', headers=False, skip_top=0, skip_bottom=0):
        pass
```

Usually the separator in csv files is the `,`, but we want to be able to change this parameter.
You can also tell the class to skip lines at top and bottom, and also to keep the first line as header is headers is True.

The file shouldn't be corrupted (line with too many elements), if it's corrupted return None.
You have to handle the case `file not found`.

You will have to also implement 2 methods: `getdata()` and `getheader()`

```py
from csvreader import CsvReader

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with Loadjson('good.csv') as file:
        data = file.getdata()
        headers = file.getheader()
```

```py
from csvreader import CsvReader

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with Loadjson('bad.csv') as file:
        if file == None:
            print("File is corrupted")
```
