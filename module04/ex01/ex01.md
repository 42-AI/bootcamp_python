| -----------------------:| ------------------ |
|   Turn-in directory:    |  ex01              |
|   Files to turn in:     |  FileLoader.py, YoungestFellah.py |
|   Allowed libraries:    |  Pandas            |
|   Remarks:              |  n/a               |

This exercise uses the following dataset: `athlete_events.csv`

Write a function `youngestFellah` that takes two arguments:

* a pandas.DataFrame which contains the dataset  
* an Olympic year.

The function returns a dictionary containing the age of the youngest woman and man who took part in the Olympics on that year. The name of the dictionary's keys is up to you, but it must be self-explanatory.

**Example:**

```python
>>> from FileLoader import FileLoader
>>> loader = FileLoader()
>>> data = loader.load('../data/athlete_events.csv')
Loading dataset of dimensions 271116 x 15
>>> from YoungestFellah import youngestFellah
>>> youngestFellah(data, 2004)
{'f': 13.0, 'm': 14.0}
```
