|   Turn-in directory:    |  ex01/              |
|   Files to turn in:     |  FileLoader.py, YoungestFellah.py |
|   Allowed libraries:    |  Pandas            |

## Objective:
Discover of the concept of slicing and indexing in ```Pandas.DataFrame```.

## Instructions:
This exercise uses the following dataset: `athlete_events.csv`

Write a function `youngestFellah` that takes two arguments as describe by the function's signature:
```python
def youngestFellah(df, year):
	"""
	Get the name of the youngest woman and man for the given year.
	Args:
	-----
		df: pandas.DataFrame object containing the dataset.
		year: integer corresponding to a year.
	Return:
	-------
		dct: dictionary with 2 keys for female and male athlete.
	Raises:
	-------
		This function should not raise any Exceptions.
    """
	... your code ...
```

The function returns a dictionary containing the age of the youngest woman and man who took part in the Olympics on that year. The name of the dictionary's keys is up to you, but it must be self-explanatory.

## Examples:

```python
>>> from FileLoader import FileLoader
>>> loader = FileLoader()
>>> data = loader.load('../ressources/athlete_events.csv')
# Output
Loading dataset of dimensions 271116 x 15

>>> from YoungestFellah import youngestFellah
>>> youngestFellah(data, 2004)
# Output
{'f': 13.0, 'm': 14.0}

>>> youngestFellah(data, 1991)
# Output
{'f': 'nan', 'm': 'nan'}
```
