|   Turn-in directory:    |  ex02              |
|   Files to turn in:     |  FileLoader.py, ProportionBySport.py |
|   Allowed libraries:    |  Pandas            |
|   Remarks:              |  n/a               |

This exercise uses the dataset `athlete_events.csv`

Write a function __proportionBySport__ that takes four arguments:

* a pandas.DataFrame of the dataset  
* an olympic year  
* a sport  
* a gender.

The function returns a float corresponding to the proportion (percentage) of participants who played the given sport among the participants of the given gender.

The function answers questions like the following : "What was the percentage of female basketball players among all the female participants of the 2016 Olympics?"

Hint: here and further, if needed, drop duplicated sportspeople to count only unique ones. Beware to call the dropping function at the right moment and with the right parameters, in order not to omit any individuals.

**Example:**

```python
>>> from FileLoader import FileLoader
>>> loader = FileLoader()
>>> data = loader.load('../data/athlete_events.csv')
Loading dataset of dimensions 271116 x 15
>>> from ProportionBySport import proportionBySport
>>> proportionBySport(data, 2004, 'Tennis', 'F')
0.01935634328358209
```

We assume that we are always using appropriate arguments as input, and thus do not need to handle input errors.
