|   Files to turn in:     |  FileLoader.py, ProportionBySport.py |
|   Allowed libraries:    |  Pandas            |

## Objective:
Practise of the concept of slicing and indexing in ```Pandas.DataFrame```.

## Insctructions:
This exercise uses the dataset `athlete_events.csv`
Write a function `proportionBySport` that takes four arguments as describe by the function's signature:
```python
def proportionBySport(df, year, sport, gender):
	"""
	Calculates the percentage of participants of specific gender for a specific sport among all the participants of the same gender for the given year.
	Args:
	-----
		df: pandas.DataFrame object containing the dataset.
		year: integer corresponding to a year.
        sport: string corresponding to a sport.
        gender: string corresponding to a gender.
	Return:
	-------
		dct: dictionary with 2 keys for female and male athlete.
	Raises:
	-------
		This function should not raise any Exceptions.
    """
	... your code ...
```

The function returns a float corresponding to the proportion (percentage) of participants who played the given sport among the participants of the given gender.

The function answers questions like the following : "What was the percentage of female basketball players among all the female participants of the 2016 Olympics?"


***Hint***: Here and further, if needed, drop duplicated sports people to count only unique ones. Beware to call the dropping function at the right moment and with the right parameters, in order to not omit any individuals.

## Examples:

```python
>>> from FileLoader import FileLoader
>>> loader = FileLoader()
>>> data = loader.load('../data/athlete_events.csv')
# Output
Loading dataset of dimensions 271116 x 15

>>> from ProportionBySport import proportionBySport
>>> proportionBySport(data, 2004, 'Tennis', 'F')
# Output
0.01935634328358209
```

We assume that we are always using appropriate arguments as input, and thus do not need to handle input errors.
