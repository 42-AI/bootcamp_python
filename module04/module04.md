# Module04 - Pandas

Today you will learn how to use a Python library that will allow you to manipulate dataframes.

## Notions of the module

Pandas! And Bamboos! (DataFrames, Series, slicing, mask ...)

## General rules

* Use the Pandas Library.
* The version of Python recommended to use is 3.7, you can check the version of Python with the following command: `python -V`
* The norm: during this bootcamp you will follow the [PEP 8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). You can install [pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle) which is a tool to check your Python code.
* The function eval is never allowed.
* The exercises are ordered from the easiest to the hardest.
* Your exercises are going to be evaluated by someone else, so make sure that your variable names and function names are appropriate and civil. 
* Your manual is the internet.
* You can also ask questions in the `#bootcamps` channel in the 42 AI Slack: 42-ai.slack.com.
* If you find any issue or mistakes in the subject please create an issue on our [bootcamp python repository on Github](https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_python/issues).

## Helper

For this module you will use the dataset `athlete_events.csv` provided in the `resources` folder.

You will need to install pandas library:

pip install pandas
```

Ensure that you have the right Python version.
