|   Turn-in directory:    |  ex04/                                   |
|   Files to turn in:     |  FileLoader.py, SpatioTemporalData.py    |
|   Allowed libraries:    |  Pandas                                  |
|   Remarks:              |  Take a look to the methods of DataFrame |

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to deepen your manipulation of ```pandas.DataFrame``` and it methods, especially the methods for slicing and indexing.

## Instructions:
You will use the dataset `athlete_events.csv`

You have to write the class ```SpatioTemporalData``` which takes a dataset (```pandas.DataFrame```) as argument in its constructor and have the two following methods:
* ```when(self, location)``` : takes a location as an argument and returns a list containing the years where games were held in the given location.  
* ```where(self, date)``` : takes a date as an argument and returns the location where the Olympics took place in the given year.

No exceptions should be risen by ```where``` and ```when```.
## Examples:

```python
>>> from FileLoader import FileLoader
>>> loader = FileLoader()
>>> data = loader.load('../ressources/athlete_events.csv')
# Output
Loading dataset of dimensions 271116 x 15

>>> from SpatioTemporalData import SpatioTemporalData
>>> sp = SpatioTemporalData(data)
>>> sp.where(1896)
# Output
['Athina']

>>> sp.where(2016)
# Output
['Rio de Janeiro']

>>> sp.when('Athina')
# Output
[2004, 1906, 1896]

>>> sp.when('Paris')
# Output
[1900, 1924]
```
