## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to deepen your manipulation of `pandas.DataFrame` and it methods, especially the methods for slicing and indexing.

## Instructions:
You will use the following dataset: `athlete_events.csv`

You have to write a function `howManyMedalsByCountry` that takes two arguments:
* a pandas.DataFrame which contains the dataset  
* a country name.

The function returns a nested dictionary which gives the number and type of medal for each competition where the country delegation earned medals.  
The keys of the main dictionary are the Olympic games' years. In each year's dictionary, the key are 'G', 'S', 'B' corresponding to the type of medals won.

Duplicated medals per team games should be handled and not counted twice. Plus, function should not raise any exceptions.

## Examples:

```python
>>> from FileLoader import FileLoader
>>> loader = FileLoader()
>>> data = loader.load('../data/athlete_events.csv')
# Output
Loading dataset of dimensions 271116 x 15

>>> from HowManyMedalsByCountry import howManyMedalsByCountry
>>> howManyMedalsByCountry(data, 'Martian Federation')
# Output
{2192: {'G': 17, 'S': 14, 'B': 23}, 2196: {'G': 8, 'S': 21, 'B': 19}, 2200: {'G': 26, 'S': 19, 'B': 7}}
```
You probably guessed but it is not a real examples.

If you want real examples, you can easily look online. Beware that some medals might be awarded or removed years after the games are over, for example if a previous medallist was found to have cheated and is sanctioned. The `athlete_events.csv` dataset might not always take these posterior changes into account.
