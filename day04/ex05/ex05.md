|   Turn-in directory :   |  ex05              |
|   Files to turn in :    |  FileLoader.py, HowManyMedalsByCountry.py |
|   Allowed libraries :   |  Pandas            |
|   Remarks :             |  n/a               |

This exercise uses the following dataset: `athlete_events.csv`

Write a function `howManyMedalsByCountry` which takes two arguments:

* a pandas.DataFrame which contains the dataset  
* a country name  

The function returns a dictionary of dictionaries giving the number and type of medal for each competition where the country team earned medals.  
The keys of the main dictionary are the Olympic games' years. In each year's dictionary, the key are 'G', 'S', 'B' corresponding to the type of medals won.

Duplicated medals per team games should be handled and not counted twice.

```python
>>> from FileLoader import FileLoader
>>> loader = FileLoader()
>>> data = loader.load('../data/athlete_events.csv')
Loading dataset of dimensions 271116 x 15
>>> from HowManyMedalsByCountry import howManyMedalsByCountry
>>> howManyMedalsByCountry(data, 'Martian Federation')
{2192: {'G': 17, 'S': 14, 'B': 23}, 2196: {'G': 8, 'S': 21, 'B': 19}, 2200: {'G': 26, 'S': 19, 'B': 7}}
```

You probably guessed by now that we gave up providing real examples...

If you want real examples, you can easily look online. Do beware that some medals might be awarded or removed years after the games are over, for example if a previous medallist was found to have cheated and is sanctioned. The `athlete_events.csv` dataset might not always take these posterior changes into account.
