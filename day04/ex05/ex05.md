The function return a dictionary of dictionaries giving the number and type of medal for each competition where the country got medals.
The keys of the main dictionary are the Olympic games' years. In each year's dictionary, the key are 'G', 'S', 'B' corresponding to the type of medals won.

```python
>>> from FileLoader import FileLoader
>>> loader = FileLoader()
>>> data = loader.load('../data/athlete_events.csv')
Loading dataset of dimensions 271116 x 15
>>> from HowManyMedalsByCountry import howManyMedalsByCountry
>>> howManyMedals(data, 'Martian Federation')
{2192: {'G': 17, 'S': 14, 'B': 23}, 2196: {'G': 8, 'S': 21, 'B': 19}, 2200: {'G': 26, 'S': 19, 'B': 7}}
```
