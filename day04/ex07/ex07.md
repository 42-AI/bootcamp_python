This exercise uses the following dataset: `athlete_events.csv`

Write a class called `Komparator` whose constructor takes as an argument a pandas.DataFrame which contains the dataset.
The class must implement the following methods, which take as input two variable names:

* `compare_box_plots(categorical_var, numerical_var)` : displays a series of box plots to compare the distribution of the numerical variable in each possible value of the categorical variable. There should be as many box plots as there are possible values of the categorical variable. For example, with Sex and Height, we would compare the distribution of height between men and women with two box plots.

* `density(categorical_var, numerical_var)` : displays the density of the numerical variable, with a different curve for the subpopulation which belongs to each categorical variable.

* `compare_histograms(categorical_var, numerical_var)` : displays separate histograms of the numerical variable for each category represented in the categorical variable. As a bonus, you can make it display overlapping histograms of different colors.

`BONUS`: Your functions can also accept a list of numerical variables, and output comparison plots for each feature against different
