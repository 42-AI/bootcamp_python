This exercise uses the dataset athlete_events.csv

Write a class called __SpatioTemporalData__ which takes a dataset (pandas DataFrame) as argument in its constructor and implements the following methods:  
- __when(location)__ : This method takes a location as an argument and returns a list containing the years where games were held in the given location.  
- __where(date)__ : This method takes a date as an argument and returns the location where the Olympics took place on the given year.

```python
>>> from FileLoader import FileLoader
>>> loader = FileLoader()
>>> data = loader.load('../data/athlete_events.csv')
Loading dataset of dimensions 271116 x 15
>>> from SpatioTemporalData import SpatioTemporalData
>>> sp = SpatioTemporalData(data)
>>> sp.where(2162)
['Neo Tokyo']
>>> sp.when('Atlanta')
[1903, 2042]
```
