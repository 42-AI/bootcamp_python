This exercise uses the dataset `athlete_events.csv`

Write a class called `SpatioTemporalData` which takes a dataset (pandas DataFrame) as argument in its constructor and implements the following methods:

* `when(location)` : takes a location as an argument and returns a list containing the years where games were held in the given location.  
* `where(date)` : takes a date as an argument and returns the location where the Olympics took place in the given year.

```python
>>> from FileLoader import FileLoader
>>> loader = FileLoader()
>>> data = loader.load('../data/athlete_events.csv')
Loading dataset of dimensions 271116 x 15
>>> from SpatioTemporalData import SpatioTemporalData
>>> sp = SpatioTemporalData(data)
>>> sp.where(1896)
['Athina']
>>> sp.where(2016)
['Rio de Janeiro']
>>> sp.when('Athina')
[2004, 1906, 1896]
>>> sp.when('Paris')
[1900, 1924]
```
