|   Turnin directory :    |  ex06              |
|   Files to turn in :    |  MyPlotLib.py      |
|   Allowed Libraries :   |  Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy|
|   Remarks :             |  The less work you do, the better! You don't necessarily need all those libraries to complete the exercise.|

This exercise uses the following dataset: athlete_events.csv

Write a class called __MyPlotLib__ which takes two arguments:  
	- a pandas.DataFrame which contains the dataset  
	- a list of feature names

- __histogram(data, features)__ : plots one histogram for each numerical feature in the list

- __density(data, features)__ : plots the density curve of each numerical feature in the list

- __pair_plot(data, features)__ : plots a matrix of subplots (also called scatter plot matrix). On each subplot shows a scatter plot of one numerical variable against another one. The main diagonal of this matrix shows simple histograms.

- __box_plot(data, features)__ : displays a box plot for each numerical variable in the dataset.
