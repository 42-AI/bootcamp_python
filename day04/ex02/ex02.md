This exercice uses the dataset athlete_event.csv

Write a function ProportionBySport which takes four arguments:
	- a pd.DataFrame of the dataset
	- an olympic year
	- a sport
	- a gender
The function return a float corresponding to the proportion (in percent) of players of the given sport and gender among all the participant of that gender.

 The function answer questions like the following : "What was the percentage of female basketball players among all the female participants of the 2016 Olympics?"

Hint: here and further if needed drop duplicated sportsmen to count only unique ones. 

```python
>>> from FileLoader import FileLoader
>>> loader = FileLoader()
>>> data = loader.load(data_set.csv)
>>> from ProportionBySport import proportionBySport
>>> proportionBySport(data, 2016, 'Basketball', 'female')
3.7
```
