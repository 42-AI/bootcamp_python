  Please respect the following rules:

  - Remain polite, courteous, respectful and constructive
    throughout the evaluation process. The well-being of the community
    depends on it.

  - Identify with the person (or the group) evaluated the eventual
    dysfunctions of the work. Take the time to discuss
    and debate the problems you have identified.

  - You must consider that there might be some difference in how your
    peers might have understood the project's instructions and the
    scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade
    him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and
    only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.

  - Only grade the work that is in the student or group's
    GiT repository.

  - Double-check that the GiT repository belongs to the student
    or the group. Ensure that the work is for the relevant project
    and also check that "git clone" is used in an empty folder.

  - Check carefully that no malicious aliases was used to fool you
    and make you evaluate something other than the content of the
    official repository.

  - To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating
    and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used
    to facilitate the grading.

  - If the evaluating student has not completed that particular
    project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the
    entire subject prior to starting the defence.

  - Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,
    non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,
    the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of
    cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are
    encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not
    finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused
    this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.
  
  - Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,
    no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected
    termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the
    appropriate flag. 
    You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.
    If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the 
    evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.

  - You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must
    be properly freed before the end of execution.
    You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as
    leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the appropriate flag.

    We will look at your bonuses if and only if your mandatory part
    is excellent. This means that your must complete the mandatory
    part, beginning to end, and your error management must be flawless,
    even in cases of twisted or bad usage. So if the mandatory part
    didn't score all the point during this defence bonuses will be
    totally ignored.
