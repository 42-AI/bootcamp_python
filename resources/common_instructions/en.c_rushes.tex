\item Your project must be written in accordance with the Norm.
        If you have bonus files/functions, they are included in the norm check
        and you will receive a \texttt{0} if there is a norm error inside.

\item Your functions should not quit unexpectedly (segmentation
        fault, bus error, double free, etc) apart from undefined
        behaviors. If this happens, your project will be considered non
        functional and will receive a \texttt{0} during the evaluation.
    
\item If the subject requires it, you must submit a \texttt{Makefile}
        which will compile your source files to the required output
        with the flags \texttt{-Wall}, \texttt{-Wextra} and \texttt{-Werror},
        use cc, and your Makefile must not relink.

\item Your \texttt{Makefile} must at least contain the rules
        \texttt{\$(NAME)}, \texttt{all}, \texttt{clean},
        \texttt{fclean} and \texttt{re}.
