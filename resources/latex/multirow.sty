%% V1.0 was distributed anonymously, based on a Usenet posting that was
%%      not intended for stand-alone use.
%% V1.1 was modified by Piet van Oostrum <piet@cs.uu.nl> to allow it to
%%      work without bigstrut.sty.
%% V1.2 was modified by Jerry Leichter for the same goal, but using a
%%      different approach which will work properly in conjunction with
%%      bigstrut.sty.
%% V1.2a was modified by Piet van Oostrum <piet@cs.uu.nl> to use \vskip
%%    instead of \raise in positioning, avoiding making rows too high
%%    when the adjustment is large.
%% V1.3 was modified by Piet van Oostrum to work properly in a p{} column
%%      (\leavevmode added)
%% V1.4 was modified by Piet van Oostrum to check for the special case that
%%      the width is given as an *. In this case the natural
%%      width of the text argument will be used and the argument
%%      is processed in LR-mode.
%% V1.5 was modified by Piet van Oostrum: Added a % after \hbox{#5}\vfill}.
%%      Added \struts around #5 for better vertical positioning.
%%      Additional coding for negative value of nrows.
%% V1.6 was modified by Piet van Oostrum: Replace a space by \relax after
%%      \advance\@tempdima#4.

% Make an entry that will span multiple rows of a table.
%
% \multirow{nrows}[bigstruts]{width}[fixup]{text}
%
% nrows is the number of rows to span.  It's up to you to leave the other
%       rows empty, or the stuff created by \multirow will over-write it.
%       With a positive value of nrows the spanned colomns are this row and
%       (nrows-1) rows below it. With a negative value of nrows they are
%       this row and (1-nrows) above it.
%
% bigstruts is mainly used if you've used bigstrut.sty.  In that case it
%       is the total number of uses of \bigstrut within the rows being
%       spanned.  Count 2 uses for each \bigstrut, 1 for each \bigstrut[x]
%       where x is either t or b.  The default is 0.
% width is the width to which the text is to be set, or * to indicate that
%       the text argument's natural width is to be used.
%
% text is the actual text.  If the width was set explicitly, the text will
%       be set in a parbox of that width; you can use \\ to force linebreaks
%       where you like.
%
%       If the width was given as * the text will be set in LR mode.  If you
%       want a multiline entry in this case you should use a tabular or array
%       in the text parameter.
%
%       The text is centered vertically within the range spanned by nrows.
%
% fixup is a length used for fine tuning:  The text will be raised (or
%       lowered, if fixup is negative) by that length above (below) wherever
%       it would otherwise have gone.
%
% For example (using both multirow and bigstrut)
%
% \newcommand{\minitab}[2][l]{\begin{tabular}{#1}#2\end{tabular}}
% \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
% \hline
% \multirow{4}{1in}{Common g text} & Column g2a\\
%       & Column g2b \\
%       & Column g2c \\
%       & Column g2d \\
% \hline
% \multirow{3}[6]*{Common g text} & Column g2a\bigstrut\\\cline{2-2}
%       & Column g2b \bigstrut\\\cline{2-2}
%       & Column g2c \bigstrut\\
% \hline
% \multirow{4}[8]{1in}{Common g text} & Column g2a\bigstrut\\\cline{2-2}
%       & Column g2b \bigstrut\\\cline{2-2}
%       & Column g2c \bigstrut\\\cline{2-2}
%       & Column g2d \bigstrut\\
% \hline
% \multirow{4}*{\minitab[c]{Common \\ g text}} & Column g2a\\
%       & Column g2b \\
%       & Column g2c \\
%       & Column g2d \\
% \hline
% \end{tabular}
%
% If any of the spanned rows are unusually large, or if you're using
% bigstrut.sty and \bigstrut's are used assymetrically about the centerline of
% the spanned rows, the vertical centering may not come out right.  Use the
% fixup argument in this case.
%
% Just before "text" is expanded, the \multirowsetup macro is expanded to
% set up any special environment.  Initially, \multirowsetup contains just
% \raggedright.  It can be redefined with \renewcommand.
%
% Bugs:  It's just about impossible to deal correctly with descenders.  The
% text will be set up centered, but it may then have a baseline that doesn't
% match the baseline of the stuff beside it, in particular if the stuff
% beside it has descenders and "text" does not.  This may result in a small
% missalignment.  About all that can be done is to do a final touchup on
% "text", using the fixup optional argument.  (Hint:  If you use a measure
% like .1ex, there's a reasonable chance that the fixup will still be correct
% if you change the point size.)
%
% \multirow is mainly designed for use with table, as opposed to array,
% environments.  It will not work well in an array environment since the lines
% have an extra \jot of space between them which it won't account for.  Fixing
% this is difficult in general, and doesn't seem worth it.  The bigstruts
% argument can be used to provide a semi-automatic fix:  First set
% \bigstrutjot to .5\jot.  Then simply repeat nrows as the bigstruts argument.
% This will be close, but probably not exact; you can use the fixup argument
% to refine the result.  (If you do this repeatedly, you'll probably want to
% wrap these steps up in a simple macro.  Note that the modified \bigstrutjot
% value will not give reasonable results if you have bigstruts and use this
% argument for its intended purpose elsewhere.  In that case, you might want
% to set it locally.)
%
% If you use \multirow with the colortbl package you have to take
% precautions if you want to color the column that has the \multirow in it.
% colortbl works by coloring each cell separately. So if you use \multirow
% with a positive nrows value, colortbl will first color the top cell, then
% \multirow will typeset nrows cells starting with this cell, and later
% colortbl will color the other cells, effectively hiding the text in that
% area. This can be solved by putting the \multirow is the last row with a
% negative nrows value.
% Example:
%  
%  \begin{tabular}{l>{\columncolor{yellow}}l}
%    aaaa & \\
%    cccc & \\
%    dddd & \multirow{-3}*{bbbb}\\
%  \end{tabular}
