**Objective:**

In this exercise, you are going to learn about the principle behind the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm by creating a `KNN` class.  

The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (or KNN for short) is a simple classification algorithm based on feature similarity. It uses a database to predict the classification of a new value. It locates from the training dataset the k-most similar values to a new value, and predicts to which category this new data point is closest to.  

**Instructions:**

Create the class `KNN` with the following methods:  

```python
class KNN:
    def __init__(self, n_neighbors=5):
        self.n_neighbors = n_neighbors # number of neighbors

    def predict(self, X):
        """
        Predict the class labels for the provided data.
        Args:
          X: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a matrice of dimension m * n.
        Returns:
          y: class labels for each data sample
        Raises:
          This function should not raise any Exception.
        """

    def score(self, X, y):
        """
        Return the mean accuracy on the given test data and labels.
        Args:
          X: Test samples
          y: True labels for X
        Returns:
          Mean accuracy of self.predict(X) wrt. y
        Raises:
          This function should not raise any Exception.
        """
```

**Dataset:**

The dataset, named __"spacecraft_data.csv"__ can be found in the resources folder.  
It contains the prices of spacecrafts in function of multiple features. A description of the dataset is provided in the file __"spacecraft_data_description.txt"__.  

**Example:**

Here is an example of the algorithm in action:
