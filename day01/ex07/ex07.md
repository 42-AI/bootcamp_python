|   Turn-in directory :   |  ex07               |
|   Files to turn in :    |  knn.py             |

In this exercise, you are going to learn about the principle behind the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

In the resources directory, you will find a dataset named __"spacecraft_data.csv"__ which contains the prices of spacecrafts in function of multiple features (multiple features means you will need a multi-linear model but hold on for the moment). A description of the dataset is provided in the file __"spacecraft_data_description.txt"__.

predict(self, X)
score(self, X, y, sample_weight=None)
