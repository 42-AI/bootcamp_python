# Exercise 00 - The Book

|                         |                    |
| -----------------------:| ------------------ |
|   Turn-in directory:    |  ex00              |
|   Files to turn in:     |  book.py, recipe.py, test.py  |
|   Forbidden functions:  |  None              |
|   Remarks:              |  n/a               |

You will provide a `test.py` file to test your classes and prove that they are working the right way.  
You can import all the classes into your test.py file by adding these lines at the top of the `test.py` file:

```py
from book import Book
from recipe import Recipe
```

You will have to make a class `Book` and a class `Recipe`

Let's describe the `Recipe` class.
It has some attributes:
* `name`            (str)  
* `cooking_lvl`     (int) : range 1 to 5  
* `cooking_time`    (int) : in minutes (no negative numbers)  
* `ingredients`     (list) : list of all ingredients each represented by a string  
* `description`     (str) : description of the recipe  
* `recipe_type`     (str) : can be "starter", "lunch" or "dessert".   

You have to initialize the object `Recipe` and check all its values, only the description can be empty.  
In case of input errors, you should print what they are and exit properly.

You will have to implement the built-in method `__str__`.  
It's the method called when you execute this code:

```py
tourte = Recipe(...)
to_print = str(tourte)
print(to_print)
```

It's implemented this way:

```py
def __str__(self):
    """Return the string to print with the recipe info"""
    txt = ""
    """Your code goes here"""
    return txt
```

The `Book` class also has some attributes:
* `name`            (str)  
* `last_update`     ([datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html))  
* `creation_date`   ([datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html))  
* `recipes_list`    (dict)   : a dictionnary why 3 keys: "starter", "lunch", "dessert".

You will have to implement some methods in `Book`:

```py
def get_recipe_by_name(self, name):
    """Print a recipe with the name `name` and return the instance"""
    pass

def get_recipes_by_types(self, recipe_type):
    """Get all recipe names for a given recipe_type """
    pass

def add_recipe(self, recipe):
    """Add a recipe to the book and update last_update"""
    pass
```

You will have to handle the error if the arg passed in add_recipe is not a `Recipe`.
