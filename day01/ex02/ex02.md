# Exercise 02 - The Vector

|                         |                     |
| -----------------------:| ------------------- |
|   Turn-in directory:    |  ex02               |
|   Files to turn in:     |  vector.py, test.py |
|   Forbidden functions:  |  None               |
|   Forbidden libraries:  |  NumPy              |
|   Remarks:              |  n/a                |

You will provide a testing file to prove that your class works as expected.  
You will have to create a helpful class, with more options and providing enhanced ease of use for the user.

In this exercise, you have to create a `Vector` class. The goal is to have vectors and be able to perform mathematical operations with them.

```py
>> v1 = Vector([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
>> v2 = v1 * 5
>> print(v2)
(Vector [0.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0])
```

It has 2 attributes:  
* `values` : a list of floats
* `size` : the size of the vector -> `Vector([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]).size == 4`

You should be able to initialize the object with either:
* a list of floats: `Vector([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])` -> then the size of the vector will be `4`
* a size: `Vector(3)` -> the vector will be created with default values starting from `0.0`: `[0.0, 1.0, 2.0]`
* a range (min, max): `Vector((10,16))` -> the vector will be created with values in the given range: `[10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 15.0]`

You will implement all the following built-in functions (called 'magic methods') for your `Vector` class:

```py
    __add__
    __radd__
    # add : vectors and scalars, can have errors with vectors.
    __sub__
    __rsub__
    # sub : vectors and scalars, can have errors with vectors.
    __truediv__
    __rtruediv__
    # div : scalars only.
    __mul__
    __rmul__
    # mul : vectors and scalars, can have errors with vectors.
    # two vectors can be multiplied using the Dot product, return a scalar.
    __str__
    __repr__
```

## Vector - Scalar authorized operations are:

- Addition between one vector (m * 1) and one scalar (1 * 1)

$$
x + a = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} 
+ a = 
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 + a \\ \vdots \\ x_m + a \end{bmatrix}
$$  

- Subtraction between one vector (m * 1) and one scalar (1 * 1)

$$
x - a = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} 
- a = 
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 - a \\ \vdots \\ x_m - a \end{bmatrix}
$$  

- Multiplication and division between one vector (m * 1) and one scalar (1 * 1)

$$
x \cdot a = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} 
\cdot a = 
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \cdot a \\ \vdots \\ x_m \cdot a \end{bmatrix}
$$  

## Vector - Vector authorized operations are:
​
- Addition between two vectors of same dimension (m * 1)

$$
x + y = 
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} + 
\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_m\end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} x_1 + y_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m + y_m \end{bmatrix}
$$  
​
- Subtraction between two vectors of same dimension (m * 1)

$$
x - y = 
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} - 
\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_m\end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} x_1 - y_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m - y_m \end{bmatrix}
$$  
​
- Compute the dot product between two vectors of same dimensons (m * 1)

$$
x \cdot y = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} 
\cdot 
\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_m\end{bmatrix} = 
\sum_{i = 1}^{m} x_i \cdot y_i =  x_1 \cdot y_1 + \dots + x_m \cdot y_m 
$$  

Don't forget to handle all kind of errors properly!
