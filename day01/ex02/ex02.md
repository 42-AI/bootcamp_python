# Exercise 02 - The vector.

You will provide a testing file to prove that your class is working the right way.  
You will have to create a better class, with more options for the user.

The goal is to have vectors and be able to perform mathematical operations with them.

```py
>> v1 = Vector([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
>> v2 = v1 * 5
>> print(v2)
(Vector [0.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0])
```

It has 2 attributes:  
* values : list of float
* lenght : size of the vector

You have to initialize the object with:
* a list of float. `Vector([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])`  
* a size `Vector(3)` -> the vector will have `values = [0.0, 1.0, 2.0]`
* a range or `Vector((10,15))` -> the vector will have `values = [10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0]`

You will implement all those built-in functions:

```py
    __add__
    __radd__
    # add : scalars and vectors, can have errors with vectors.
    __sub__
    __rsub__
    # sub : scalars and vectors, can have errors with vectors.
    __truediv__
    __rtruediv__
    # div : only scalars.
    __mul__
    __rmul__
    # mul : scalars and vectors, can have errors with vectors, 
    # return a scalar is we perform Vector * Vector (dot product)
    __str__
    __repr__
```

Don't forget to handle all kind of errors properly !
