It's all about security.  
Have a look at the class named `Account` in the snippet of code below.

```py
# in the_bank.py
class Account(object):

    ID_COUNT = 1

    def __init__(self, name, **kwargs):
        self.id = self.ID_COUNT
        self.name = name
        self.__dict__.update(kwargs)
        if hasattr(self, 'value'):
            self.value = 0
        Account.ID_COUNT += 1
    
    def transfer(self, amount):
        self.value += amount

```

Now, it is your turn to code a class named `Bank`!  
Its purpose will be to handle the security part of each transfer attempt.

Security means checking if the `Account` is:
* the right object
* not corrupted
* and stores enough money to complete the transfer.

How do we define if a bank account is corrupted? A corrupted bank account has:
* an even number of attributes
* an attribute starting with `b`
* no attribute starting with `zip` or `addr`
* no attribute `name`, `id` and `value`

A transaction is invalid if `amount < 0` or if the amount is larger than the available funds of the sending account.

```py
# in the_bank.py
class Bank(object):
    """The bank"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.account = []

    def add(self, account):
        self.account.append(account)

    def transfer(self, origin, dest, amount):
        """
            @origin:  int(id) or str(name) of the first account
            @dest:    int(id) or str(name) of the destination account
            @amount:  float(amount) amount to transfer
            @return         True if success, False if an error occured
        """

    def fix_account(self, account):
        """
            fix the corrupted account
            @account: int(id) or str(name) of the account
            @return         True if success, False if an error occured
        """
```

WARNING: YOU WILL HAVE TO MODIFY THE INSTANCES' ATTRIBUTES IN ORDER TO FIX THEM.
