You will have to make a class and its children.

Create a `GotCharacter` class and initialize it with the following attributes:

* `first_name`
* `is_alive` (by default is `True`)

Pick up a GoT House (e.g., Stark, Lannister...). Create a child class that inherits from `GotCharacter` and define the following attributes:

* `family_name` (by default should be the same as the Class)
* `house_words` (e.g., the House words for the Stark House is: "Winter is Coming")


Example:

```py
class Stark(GotCharacter):
    def __init__(self, first_name=None, is_alive=True):
        super().__init__(first_name=first_name, is_alive=is_alive)
        self.family_name = "Stark"
        self.house_words = "Winter is Coming"
```

Add two methods to your child class:

* `print_house_words`: prints to screen the House words
* `die`: changes the value of `is_alive` to `False`


Running commands in the Python console, an example of what you should get:

```console
> python
>>> from game import GotCharacter, Stark
>>> arya = Stark("Arya")
>>> print(arya.__dict__)
{'first_name': 'Arya', 'is_alive': True, 'family_name': 'Stark', 'house_words': 'Winter is Coming'}
>>> arya.print_house_words()
Winter is Coming
>>> print(arya.is_alive)
True
>>> arya.die()
>>> print(arya.is_alive)
False
```

You can add any attribute or method you need to your class and format the docstring the way you want to.  
Feel free to create other children of `GotCharacter`.

```console
>>> print(arya.__doc__)
A class representing the Stark family. Or when bad things happen to good people.
```
