Code a function evaluate, that takes 2 lists in parameters.

```py
def evaluate(coefs, words):
    ...
    return score
```

The goal of the function is to calculate the sum of the len of every `words` of a given list weighted by a list a `coefs`.

`coefs` and `words` has to be the same len, if it's not the case the function should  return -1.

You have to do it using zip in the zip_eval.py file, and with enumerate in the enumerate_eval.py.

```py
>> words = ["Le", "Lorem", "Ipsum", "est", "simplement"]
>> coefs = [1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 4.0, 0.5]
>> evaluate(coefs, words)
34.0
```
