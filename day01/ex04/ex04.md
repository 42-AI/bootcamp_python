Code a function `evaluate`, that takes 2 lists as parameters.

```py
def evaluate(coefs, words):
    ...
    return score
```

The goal of the function is to calculate the sum of the len of every `words` of a given list weighted by a list a `coefs`.

`coefs` and `words` has to be the same len, if it's not the case the function should return -1.

You have to do it using `zip` in the zip_eval.py file, and with `enumerate` in the enumerate_eval.py.

```py
>> from zip_eval import evaluate as zip_evaluate
>> from enumerate_eval import evaluate as enumerate_evaluate
>> words = ["Le", "Lorem", "Ipsum", "est", "simple"]
>> coefs = [1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 4.0, 0.5]
>> zip_evaluate(coefs, words)
34.0
>> words = ["Le", "Lorem", "Ipsum", "n'", "est", "pas", "simple"]
>> coefs = [0.0, -1.0, 1.0, -12.0, 0.0, 42.42]
>> enumerate_evaluate(coefs, words)
-1
```
