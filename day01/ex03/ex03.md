# Exercise 03 - The matrix.

|                         |                     |
| -----------------------:| ------------------- |
|   Turn-in directory :   |  ex03               |
|   Files to turn in :    |  matrix.py<br>test.py |
|   Forbidden functions : |  None              |
|   Forbidden libraries : |  Numpy             |
|   Remarks :             |  n/a                |

You will provide a testing file to prove that your class works as expected.  
You will have to create a helpful class, with more options and providing enhanced ease of use for the user.

In this exercise, you have to create a `Matrix` class. The goal is to have matrices and be able to perform mathematical operations with them.
