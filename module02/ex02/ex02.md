You are going to learn some more advanced features of Python!  
In this exercise, we want you to learn about decorators, and we are not talking about the decoration of your room.  
The `@log` will write info about the decorated function in a `machine.log` file.  

```py
import time
from random import randint

class CoffeeMachine():

    water_level = 100

    @log
    def start_machine(self):
      if self.water_level > 20:
          return True
      else:
          print("Please add water!")
          return False
    
    @log
    def boil_water(self):
        return "boiling..."
    
    @log
    def make_coffee(self):
        if self.start_machine():
            for _ in range(20):
                time.sleep(0.1)
                self.water_level -= 1
            print(self.boil_water())
            print("Coffee is ready!")
    
    @log
    def add_water(self, water_level):
        time.sleep(randint(1, 5))
        self.water_level += water_level
        print("Blub blub blub...")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    
    machine = CoffeeMachine()
    for i in range(0, 5):
        machine.make_coffee()

    machine.make_coffee()
    machine.add_water(70)

```

**Example:**

```bash
boiling...
Coffee is ready!
boiling...
Coffee is ready!
boiling...
Coffee is ready!
boiling...
Coffee is ready!
Please add water!
Please add water!
Blub blub blub...
```

```bash
> cat machine.log
(cmaxime)Running: Start Machine 	[ exec-time = 0.001 ms ]
(cmaxime)Running: Boil Water 	    [ exec-time = 0.005 ms ]
(cmaxime)Running: Make Coffee 	    [ exec-time = 2.499 s  ]
(cmaxime)Running: Start Machine 	[ exec-time = 0.002 ms ]
(cmaxime)Running: Boil Water 	    [ exec-time = 0.005 ms ]
(cmaxime)Running: Make Coffee 	    [ exec-time = 2.618 s  ]
(cmaxime)Running: Start Machine 	[ exec-time = 0.003 ms ]

(cmaxime)Running: Make Coffee 	    [ exec-time = 2.648 s  ]
(cmaxime)Running: Start Machine 	[ exec-time = 0.011 ms ]
(cmaxime)Running: Make Coffee 	    [ exec-time = 0.029 ms ]
(cmaxime)Running: Start Machine 	[ exec-time = 0.009 ms ]
(cmaxime)Running: Make Coffee 	    [ exec-time = 0.024 ms ]
(cmaxime)Running: Add Water 	    [ exec-time = 5.026 s  ]
