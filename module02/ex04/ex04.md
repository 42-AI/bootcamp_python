You have to create a package called `ai42`.

It will have 2 functionalities: 
* the progress bar (module00 ex10), that can be imported via `import ai42.progressbar`
* the logger (module02 ex02) `import ai42.logging.log`.

You may have to rename the functions and change the architecture of the package.

The package will be installed via pip using the following command:  
```console
bash build.sh && pip install ./dist/ai42-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

The build.sh script has to create the `ai42-1.0.0.tar.gz` file.  

You can ensure whether the package was properly installed by running the command `pip list` that displays the list of installed packages.
