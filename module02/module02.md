# Module02 - Basics 3

Let's continue practicing with more advanced Python programming exercises.

## Notions of the module

Decorators, multiprocessing, lambda, build package, ...

## General rules

* The version of Python to use is 3.7, you can check the version of Python with the following command: `python -V`
* The norm: during this bootcamp you will follow the [PEP 8 standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). You can install [pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle) which is a tool to check your Python code.
* The function eval is never allowed.
* The exercises are ordered from the easiest to the hardest.
* Your exercises are going to be evaluated by someone else, so make sure that your variable names and function names are appropriate and civil. 
* Your manual is the internet.
* You can also ask questions in the dedicated channel in the 42 AI Slack: 42-ai.slack.com.
* If you find any issue or mistakes in the subject please create an issue on our [dedicated repository on Github](https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_python/issues).
