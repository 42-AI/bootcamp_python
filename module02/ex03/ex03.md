## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to implement a context manager as a class.
Thus you are strongly encouraged to do some research about context manager.

## Instructions:
Implement a `CsvReader` class that opens, reads, and parses a CSV file.
This class is then a context manager as class.
In order to create it, your class requires few built-in methods:
* `__init__`,
* `__enter__`,
* `__exit__`.

It is mandatory to close the file once the process has completed.
You are expected to handle properly badly formatted CSV file (i.e. handle the exception):
* mistmatch between number of fields and number of records,
* records with different length.


```py
class CsvReader():
	def __init__(self, filename=None, sep=',', header=False, skip_top=0, skip_bottom=0):
		... Your code ...

	def __enter__(...):
		... Your code ...
	
	def __exit__(...):
		... Your code ...
	
	def getdata(self):
	""" Retrieves the data/records from skip_top to skip bottom.
	Return:
	-------
		nested list (list(list, list, ...)) representing the data.
	"""
		... Your code ...

	def getheader(self):
	""" Retrieves the header from csv file.
	Return:
	-------
		list: representing the data (when self.header is True).
        None: (when self.header is False).
	"""
		... Your code ...
```

CSV (for Comma-Separated Values) file is a delimited text file which uses a comma to separate values.
Therefore, the field separator (or delimiter) is usually a comma (`,`)
but with your context manager you have to offer the possibility to change this parameter.

You can make the class skip lines at the top and the bottom of the file,
and also keep the first line as a header if `header` is `True`.

The file should not be corrupted (either a line with too many values or a line with too few values), otherwise return `None`.
You also have to handle the case `file not found`.
You have to implement two methods:
* `getdata()` ,
* `getheader()`.

```py
from csvreader import CsvReader

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with CsvReader('good.csv') as file:
        data = file.getdata()
        header = file.getheader()
```

```py
from csvreader import CsvReader

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with CsvReader('bad.csv') as file:
        if file == None:
            print("File is corrupted")
```
