## Objective:
The goal of the exercise is to get you used with built-in methods, more
particularly with those allowing to perform operations.
Student is expected to code built-in methods for vector-vector and
vector-scalar operations as rigorously as possible.


## Intructions:
In this exercise, you have to create a `Vector` class. The goal is to create vectors and be able to perform mathematical operations with them.
* Column vectors are represented as list of lists of single float (`[[1.], [2.], [3.]]`),
* Row vectors are represented as a list of a list of several floats (`[[1., 2., 3.]]`).

### Warning:
A vector is either a single line of floats or a single column of floats. When more than a line/column is consider, it is a matrix, not a vector.


The class should also have 2 attributes:  
* `values`: list of list of floats (for row vector) or list of lists of single float (for column vector),
* `shape`: tuple of 2 integers: $(1,n)$ for a row vector of dimension $n$ or $(n,1)$ for a column vector of dimension $n$.
  

### Information:
If you did not learn at school what is the dimension of a vector, don't worry.
But for now do not think too hard about what dimension means.
Just consider the dimension is the number of floats (elements/coordinates) of a vector, and shape gives the layout: if $(1, n)$ the vector is a row, if $(n,1)$ the vector is a column.


Finally you have to implement 2 methods:
* `dot()`: produce a dot product between 2 vectors of the same `shape`,
* `T()`: returns the transpose vector (i.e. a column vector into a row vector or a row vector into a column vector).

You will also provide a testing file (`test.py`) to demonstrate your class
works as expected. In this testing file, demonstrate:
* the addition and substraction are working for 2 vectors of the same shape,
* the mutliplication (`mul` and `rmul`) are working for a vector and a scalar,
* the division (`truediv`) is working with a vector and a scalar,
* the division (`rtruediv`) raises an Arithmetic Error (this test can be commented for the other tests and uncommented to show this one),

## Examples:
```py
# Column vector of dimensions n * 1
>> v1 = Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
>> v2 = v1 * 5
>> print(v2)
Vector([[0.0], [5.0], [10.0], [15.0]])

# Row vector of dimensions 1 * n
v1 = Vector([[0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]])
v1 * 5
# Output
Vector([[0.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0]])

v1 / 2.0
# Output
Vector([[0.0], [0.5], [1.0], [1.5]])

v1 / 0.0
# Output
...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero.

2.0 / v1
# Output:
...
NotImplementedError: Division of a scalar by a Vector is not defined here.
```

```py
# Column vector of shape (n, 1)
Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]]).shape
# Output
(4,1)

Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]]).values
# Output
[[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]]

# Row vector of shape (1, n)
Vector([[0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]]).shape
# Output
(1,4) 

Vector([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]).values
# Output
[[0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]]
```

```python
# Example 1:
v1 = Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
v1.shape
# Output:
(4,1)

v1.T()
# Output:
Vector([[0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]])

v1.T().shape
# Output:
(1,4)

# Example 2:
v2 = Vector([[0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]])
v2.shape
# Output:
(1,4)

v2.T()
# Output:
Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])

v2.T().shape
# Output:
(4,1)
```

```py
# Column vector of shape (n, 1)
v1 = Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
v2 = Vector([[2.0], [1.5], [2.25], [4.0]])
v1.dot(v2)
# Output
18.0

v3 = Vector([[1.0, 3.0]])
v4 = Vector([[2.0, 4.0]])
v3.dot(v4)
# Output:
13.0

v1
# Output: to see what __repr__() should do
[[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]]

print(v1)
# Output: to see what __str__() should do
[[0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]]
```

You should be able to initialize the object with:
* a list of floats: `Vector([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])`,
* a list of lists of float: `Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])`,
* a size: `Vector(3)` -> the vector will be: `[[0.0], [1.0], [2.0]]`,
* a range (min, max): `Vector((10,16))` -> the vector will be: `[[10.0], [11.0], [12.0], [13.0], [14.0], [15.0]]`.

*By default, the vectors are generated as classical column vectors if initialized with a size of a range.*

To perform arithmetic operations for Vector-Vector or scalar-Vector, you have to implement all the following built-in functions (also called 'magic methods') for your `Vector` class:

```py
__add__
__radd__
# add & radd : only vectors of same shape.
__sub__
__rsub__
# sub & rsub: only vectors of same shape.
__truediv__
# truediv : only with scalars (to perform division of Vector by a scalar).
__rtruediv__
# rtruediv : raises an NotImplementedError with the message "Division of a scalar by a Vector is not defined re."
__mul__
__rmul__
# mul & rmul: only scalars (to perform multiplication of Vector by a scalar).
__str__
__repr__
# must be identical, i.e we expect that print(vector) and vector within python interpretor behave the same, see examples below.
```
### Information:
So it might be a good idea to implement `values` and `shape` before built-in arithmetic functions.
For the case not specify (e.g vector * vector) you should raise `NotImplementedError`.

## Mathematic notions:
### Scalar-Vector authorized operations are:

- Multiplication and division between one $m$ dimensional vector and one scalar:

$$
x \cdot a = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} 
\cdot a = 
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \cdot a \\ \vdots \\ x_m \cdot a \end{bmatrix}
$$  

### Vector-Vector authorized operations are:
​
- Addition between two vectors of same dimension $m$:

$$
x + y = 
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} + 
\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_m\end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} x_1 + y_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m + y_m \end{bmatrix}
$$  
​
- Subtraction between two vectors of same dimension $m$:

$$
x - y = 
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} - 
\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_m\end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} x_1 - y_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m - y_m \end{bmatrix}
$$  
​
- Compute the dot product between two vectors of same dimenson $m$:

$$
x \cdot y = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} 
\cdot 
\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_m\end{bmatrix} = 
\sum_{i = 1}^{m} x_i \cdot y_i =  x_1 \cdot y_1 + \dots + x_m \cdot y_m 
$$  

Don't forget to handle all kind of errors properly!
