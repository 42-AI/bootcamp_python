## Objective:
The goal of the exercise is to get you used with built-in methods, more
particularly with those allowing to perform operations.
Student is expected to code built-in methods for vector-vector and
vector-scalar operations as rigorously as possible.


## Intructions:
In this exercise, you have to create a `Vector` class. The goal is to create vectors and be able to perform mathematical operations with them.
* Column vectors are represented as list of lists of one float,
* Row vectors are represented as list of floats.

The class should also have 2 attributes:  
* `values`: a list (or a list of lists) of floats,
* `shape`: dimension of the vector.

Finally you have to implement 2 methods:
* `dot()`: produce a dot product with the vector given as parameter (should have the of same shape),
* `T()`: returns the transpose vector (i.e. a column vector into a row vector or a row vector into a column vector).

You will also provide a testing file `test.py` to demonstrate your class works as expected.

## Examples:
```py
# Column vector of dimensions n * 1
>> v1 = Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
>> v2 = v1 * 5
>> print(v2)
(Vector [[0.0], [5.0], [10.0], [15.0]])

# Row vector of dimensions 1 * n
v1 = Vector([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
v2 = v1 * 5
# Output
Vector([0.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0])
```

```py
# Column vector of dimensions n * 1
Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]]).shape
# Output
(4,1)

Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]]).values
# Output
[[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]]

# Row vector of dimensions 1 * n
Vector([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]).shape
# Output
(1, 4) 

Vector([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]).values
# Output
[0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0] 
```

```py
# Column vector of dimensions n * 1
v1 = Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])
v2 = Vector([[2.0], [1.5], [2.25], [4.0]])
v1.dot(v2)
# Output
18

v1
# Output
[[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]]

v1.T()
# Output
[0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
```

You should be able to initialize the object with:
* a list of floats: `Vector([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0])`,
* a list of lists of float: `Vector([[0.0], [1.0], [2.0], [3.0]])`,
* a size: `Vector(3)` -> the vector will be: `[[0.0], [1.0], [2.0]]`,
* a range (min, max): `Vector((10,16))` -> the vector will be: `[[10.0], [11.0], [12.0], [13.0], [14.0], [15.0]]`.

*By default, the vectors are generated as classical column vectors if initialized with a size of a range.*

To perform arithmetic operations for Vector-Vector or scalar-Vector, you have to implement all the following built-in functions (also called 'magic methods') for your `Vector` class:

```py
    __add__
    __radd__
    # add : handle vector-vector and scalar-vector addition, can have errors with vector-vector.
    __sub__
    __rsub__
    # sub : handle vector-vector and scalar-vector substraction, can have errors with vector-vector.
    __truediv__
    __rtruediv__
    # div : scalars only.
    __mul__
    __rmul__
    # mul : handle vector-vector and scalar-vector multiplication, can have errors with vector-vector.
    # two vectors can be multiplied using the Dot product, return a scalar.
    __str__
    __repr__
```

## Mathematic notions:
### Scalar-Vector authorized operations are:

- Multiplication and division between one vector (m * 1) and one scalar:

$$
x \cdot a = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} 
\cdot a = 
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \cdot a \\ \vdots \\ x_m \cdot a \end{bmatrix}
$$  

### Vector-Vector authorized operations are:
​
- Addition between two vectors of same dimension (m * 1):

$$
x + y = 
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} + 
\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_m\end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} x_1 + y_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m + y_m \end{bmatrix}
$$  
​
- Subtraction between two vectors of same dimension (m * 1):

$$
x - y = 
\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} - 
\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_m\end{bmatrix} 
= \begin{bmatrix} x_1 - y_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m - y_m \end{bmatrix}
$$  
​
- Compute the dot product between two vectors of same dimenson (m * 1):

$$
x \cdot y = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ \vdots \\ x_m\end{bmatrix} 
\cdot 
\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_m\end{bmatrix} = 
\sum_{i = 1}^{m} x_i \cdot y_i =  x_1 \cdot y_1 + \dots + x_m \cdot y_m 
$$  

Don't forget to handle all kind of errors properly!
