Code a class `Evaluator`, that has two static functions named `zip_evaluate` and `enumerate_evaluate`.

The goal of these 2 functions is to compute the sum of the lengths of every `words` of a given list weighted by a list a `coefs`.

The lists `coefs` and `words` have to be the same length. If this is not the case, the function should return -1.

You have to obtain the desired result using `zip` in the `zip_evaluate` function, and with `enumerate` in the `enumerate_evaluate` function.

**Example:**

```py
>> from eval import Evaluator
>> 
>> words = ["Le", "Lorem", "Ipsum", "est", "simple"]
>> coefs = [1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 4.0, 0.5]
>> Evaluator.zip_evaluate(coefs, words)
32.0
>> words = ["Le", "Lorem", "Ipsum", "n'", "est", "pas", "simple"]
>> coefs = [0.0, -1.0, 1.0, -12.0, 0.0, 42.42]
>> Evaluator.enumerate_evaluate(coefs, words)
-1
```
