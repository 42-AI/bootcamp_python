## Objective:
The goal of the exercise is to get you familiar with the notions of
classes and the manipulation of the objects related to those classes.

## Instructions:

You will have to make a class `Book` and a class `Recipe`

Let's describe the `Recipe` class.
It has some attributes:
* `name` (str): name of the recipe,
* `cooking_lvl` (int): range from 1 to 5,
* `cooking_time` (int): in minutes (no negative numbers),
* `ingredients` (list): list of all ingredients each represented by a string,
* `description` (str): description of the recipe,
* `recipe_type` (str): can be "starter", "lunch" or "dessert".

You have to **initialize** the object `Recipe` and check all its values, only the description can be empty.
In case of input errors, you should print what they are and exit properly.

You will have to implement the built-in method `__str__`.
It's the method called when the following code is executed:

```py
tourte = Recipe(...)
to_print = str(tourte)
print(to_print)
```

It's implemented this way:

```py
def __str__(self):
    """Return the string to print with the recipe info"""
    txt = ""
    #... Your code here ...
    return txt
```

The `Book` class also has some attributes:
* `name` (str): name of the book,
* `last_update` ([datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)): the date of the last update,
* `creation_date` ([datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)): the creation date,
* `recipes_list` (dict): a dictionnary with 3 keys: "starter", "lunch", "dessert".

You will have to implement some methods in `Book` class:

```py
def get_recipe_by_name(self, name):
    """Print a recipe with the name `name` and return the instance"""
    #... Your code here ...

def get_recipes_by_types(self, recipe_type):
    """Get all recipe names for a given recipe_type """
    #... Your code here ...

def add_recipe(self, recipe):
    """Add a recipe to the book and update last_update"""
    #... Your code here ...
```
You will have to handle the error if the argument passed in `add_recipe` is not a `Recipe`.


Finally, you will provide a `test.py` file to test your classes and prove that they are working well.
You can import all the classes into your test.py file by adding these lines at the top of the `test.py` file:

```py
from book import Book
from recipe import Recipe

# ... Your tests ...
```
