ALERT! DATA CORRUPTED

**Objective:**
The solar system census dataset is corrupted! The citizens' homeland are missing!
You must implement the K-means clustering algorithm in order to find the citizens origin.

**Instructions:**
Create the class KmeansClustering with the following functions :
```python
class KmeansClustering:
    def __init__(self, max_iter=20, ncentroid=5):
        self.ncentroid = ncentroid # number of centroids
        self.max_iter = max_iter # number of max iterations to update the centroids
        self.centroids = [] # values of the centroids
        
    def fit(self, X):
        """
        Run the K-means clustering algorithm.
        For the location of the initial centroids, random pick ncentroids from the dataset.
        Args:
          X: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a matrice of dimension m * n.
        Returns:
          None.
        Raises:
          This function should not raise any Exception.
        """

    def predict(self, X):
        """
        Predict from wich cluster each datapoint belongs to.
        Args:
          X: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a matrice of dimension m * n.
        Returns:
          the prediction has a numpy.ndarray, a vector of dimension m * 1.
        Raises:
          This function should not raise any Exception.
        """
        
    def score(self, X):
        """
        Use distortion metrics to predict score of the class.
        Args:
          X: has to be an numpy.ndarray, a matrice of dimension m * n.
        Returns:
          The result has a float.
        Raises:
          This function should not raise any Exception.
        """
```
**Dataset:**
The dataset, named **solar_system_census** can be found in the resources folder.
It is a part of the solar system census dataset. It contains biometric informations such as the height, weight, and bone density of solar system citizens.   

As you should know solar citizens come from four registered area: The flying cities of Venus, United Nations of Earth, Mars Republic, and the Asteroids' Belt colonies.    

Unfortunately the data about the planets of origin was lost... 
Use your K-means algorithm to try to find it! 
Once your clusters are found, try to find which one correspond to wich origin. 

***Hints:***
- People are slender on Venus than on Earth.
- People of the Martian Republic are taller than on Earth.
- Citizens of the Belt are the tallest of the solar system and have the lowest bone density due to the lack of gravity.
