Write a class named `AdvancedFilter` which implements the following methods.  
All methods take in a 3D NumPy array (as in, a tensor of rank 3) and return a modified copy of the array.

The following video should be used as a resource for completing the exercise:

* `mean_blur()` : This method receives an image, performs a mean blur on it and returns a blurred copy. In a mean blur, each pixel becomes the average of its neighboring pixels.

* `gaussian_blur()` : This method receives an image, performs a gaussian blur on it and returns a blurred copy. In a gaussian blur, the weighting of the neighboring pixels is adjusted so that closer pixels are more heavily counted in the average.

`BONUS` : You can add an optional argument to those methods to choose the kernel size.

Remember, you can add helper methods to your class!
