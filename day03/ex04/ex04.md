Now you will build a tool that can apply a variety of colors filters on images. 
For this exercice, the authorized functions and operators are specified for each methods. You are not allowed to use anything else. 

Write a class named ColorFilter which implements the following methods:
- __invert()__ : Takes a numpy array of an image as an argument and returns an array with inverted color. 
Authorized function : None
Authorized operator: - 

- __green()__ : Takes a numpy array of an image as an argument and returns an array with a blue filter. 
Authorized function : .zeros, .shape
Authorized operator: None

- __red()__ : Takes a numpy array of an image as an argument and returns an array with a green filter. 
Authorized function : None
Authorized operator: * 

- __blue()__ : Takes a numpy array of an image as an argument and returns an array with a red filter. 
Authorized function : green, blue
Authorized operator: -, + 

- __greyscale()__ : Takes a numpy array of an image as an argument and returns an array in greyscale. 
Authorized function :
Authorized operator:
