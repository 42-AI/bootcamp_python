# Bootcamp Python

# Day03 - NumPy

Today you will learn how to use the Python library that will allow you to manipulate multidimensional arrays (vectors, matrices, tensors...) and perform complex mathematical operations on them.

## Notions of the day

NumPy array, slicing, stacking, dimensions, broadcasting, normalization, etc...

## General rules

* Use the NumPy Library: use NumPy's built-in functions as much as possible. Here you will be given no credit for reinventing the wheel.
* The version of Python to use is 3.7, you can check the version of Python with the following command: `python -V`
* The norm: during this bootcamp you will follow the Pep8 standards <href src="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"><u><font color=blue>https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/</font></u></href>
* The function eval is never allowed.
* The exercises are ordered from the easiest to the hardest.
* Your exercises are going to be evaluated by someone else, so make sure that your variable names and function names are appropriate and civil. 
* Your manual is the internet.
* You can also ask questions in the dedicated channel in the 42 AI Slack: 42-ai.slack.com.
* If you find any issue or mistakes in the subject please create an issue on our dedicated repository on Github:  <href src="https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_python/issues"><u><font color=blue>https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_python/issues</font></u></href>.

## Helper

Ensure that you have the right Python version.

```
> which python
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/python
> python -V
Python 3.7.*
> which pip
/goinfre/miniconda/bin/pip
```
