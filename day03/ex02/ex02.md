Write a class named ScrapBooker which implements the following methods.
All methods take in a NumPy array and return a new modified one.

- __crop(array, dimensions, position)__ : crop the image as a rectangle with the given dimensions, whose top left corner is given by the _position_ argument. The position should be (0,0) by default

- __thin(array, n, axis)__ : delete every nth pixel along the specified axis (0 vertical, 1 horizontal)

- __juxtapose(array, n, axis)__ : juxtapose _n_ copies of the image along the specified axis (0 vertical, 1 horizontal)

- __mosaic(array, dimensions)__ : make a grid with multiple copies of the array. The _dimensions_ argument specifies the dimensions of the grid (e.g. 2x3)

__NOTE__ : In this exercise, when specifying positions or dimensions, we will assume that the first coordinate is counted along the vertical axis starting from the TOP, and that the second coordinate is counted along the horizontal axis starting from the left. Indexing starts from 0.

e.g.:    
(1,3)  
.....  
...x.  
.....
