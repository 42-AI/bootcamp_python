Write a class named ScrapBooker which implements the following methods.
All methods take in a NumPy array and return a new modified one.
We are assuming that all inputs are right, you don't have to protect your functions.

* `crop(array, dimensions, position)` : crop the image as a rectangle with the given `dimensions` (it's the new image size), whose top left corner is given by the `position` argument. The position should be (0,0) by default. You have to handle error if dimensions is larger than the current image size.

* `thin(array, n, axis)` : delete every n-th pixel row along the specified axis (0 vertical, 1 horizontal).

example:
```
permorm thin with n=3 and axis=0:
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL  ==>   ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ

permorm thin with n=4 and axis=1:
AAAAAAAAAAAA        
BBBBBBBBBBBB        AAAAAAAAAAAA
CCCCCCCCCCCC        BBBBBBBBBBBB
DDDDDDDDDDDD        CCCCCCCCCCCC
EEEEEEEEEEEE        EEEEEEEEEEEE
FFFFFFFFFFFF  ==>   FFFFFFFFFFFF
GGGGGGGGGGGG        GGGGGGGGGGGG
HHHHHHHHHHHH        IIIIIIIIIIII
IIIIIIIIIIII        JJJJJJJJJJJJ
JJJJJJJJJJJJ        KKKKKKKKKKKK
KKKKKKKKKKKK        
LLLLLLLLLLLL        
```

* `juxtapose(array, n, axis)` : juxtapose `n` copies of the image along the specified axis (0 vertical, 1 horizontal).

* `mosaic(array, dimensions)` : make a grid with multiple copies of the array. The `dimensions` (it's the size of the grid) argument specifies the dimensions of the grid (e.g. 2x3).

`NOTE` : In this exercise, when specifying positions or dimensions, we will assume that the first coordinate is counted along the vertical axis starting from the TOP, and that the second coordinate is counted along the horizontal axis starting from the left. Indexing starts from 0.

e.g.:    
(1,3)  
.....  
...x.  
.....
