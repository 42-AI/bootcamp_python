Write a class named `ScrapBooker` which implements the following methods.  
All methods take in a NumPy array and return a new modified one.  
We are assuming that all inputs are correct, i.e. you don't have to protect your functions against input errors.

* `crop(array, dimensions, position)` : crops the image as a rectangle with the given `dimensions` (meaning, the new height and width for the image), whose top left corner is given by the `position` argument. The position should be (0,0) by default. You have to consider it an error (and handle said error) if `dimensions` is larger than the current image size.

* `thin(array, n, axis)` : deletes every n-th pixel row along the specified axis (0 vertical, 1 horizontal), example below.

* `juxtapose(array, n, axis)` : juxtaposes `n` copies of the image along the specified axis (0 vertical, 1 horizontal).

* `mosaic(array, dimensions)` : makes a grid with multiple copies of the array. The `dimensions` argument specifies the dimensions (meaning the height and width) of the grid (e.g. 2x3).

`NOTE` : In this exercise, when specifying positions or dimensions, we will assume that the first coordinate is counted along the vertical axis starting from the TOP, and that the second coordinate is counted along the horizontal axis starting from the left. Indexing starts from 0.

e.g.:    
(1,3)  
.....  
...x.  
.....

example for thin:
```
perform thin with n=3 and axis=0:
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL  ==>   ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ
ABCDEFGHIJQL        ABDEGHJQ

perform thin with n=4 and axis=1:
AAAAAAAAAAAA        
BBBBBBBBBBBB        AAAAAAAAAAAA
CCCCCCCCCCCC        BBBBBBBBBBBB
DDDDDDDDDDDD        CCCCCCCCCCCC
EEEEEEEEEEEE        EEEEEEEEEEEE
FFFFFFFFFFFF  ==>   FFFFFFFFFFFF
GGGGGGGGGGGG        GGGGGGGGGGGG
HHHHHHHHHHHH        IIIIIIIIIIII
IIIIIIIIIIII        JJJJJJJJJJJJ
JJJJJJJJJJJJ        KKKKKKKKKKKK
KKKKKKKKKKKK        
LLLLLLLLLLLL
