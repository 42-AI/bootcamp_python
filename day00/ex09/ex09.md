You will have to make a program that will be an interactive guessing game. It will ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 99. The program will tell the user if their input is too high or too low. The game ends when the user finds out the secret number or types `exit`.  
You will have to import the `random` module with the `randint` function to get a random number. 
You have to count the number of trials and print that number when the user wins.

**Example:**

```console
> python guess.py
This is an interactive guessing game!
You have to enter a number between 1 and 99 to find out the secret number.
Type 'exit' to end the game.
Good luck!

What's your guess between 1 and 99?
>> 54
Too high!
What's your guess between 1 and 99?
>> 34
Too low!
What's your guess between 1 and 99?
>> 45
Too high!
What's your guess between 1 and 99?
>> A
That's not a number.
What's your guess between 1 and 99?
>> 43
Congratulations, you've got it!
You won in 5 attempts!
```

If the user discovers the secret number on the first try, tell them.
Bonus: if the secret number is 42, make a reference to Douglas Adams.

```console
> python guess.py
What's your guess between 1 and 99?
>> 42
The answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything is 42.
Congratulations! You got it on your first try!
```

Other example:
```console
> python guess.py
This is an interactive guessing game!
You have to enter a number between 1 and 99 to find out the secret number.
Type 'exit' to end the game.
Good luck!

What's your guess between 1 and 99?
>> exit
Goodbye!
```
