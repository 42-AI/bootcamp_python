|   Files to turn in:     |  exec.py           |

You will have to make a program that reverses the order of a string and the case of its words.  
If we have more than one argument we have to merge them into a single string and separate each arg by a ' ' (space char).

**Example:**

```console
> python exec.py "Hello World\!" | cat -e
!DLROw OLLEh$
> python exec.py "Hello" "my Friend" | cat -e
DNEIRf YM OLLEh$
> python exec.py
>
```
