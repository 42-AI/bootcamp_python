|   Turn-in directory :   |  ex01              |
|   Files to turn in :    |  exec.py           |
|   Forbidden functions : |  None              |

You will have to make a program that reverses the order of a string and the case of its words.  
If we have more than one argument we have to merge them into a single string and separate each arg by a ' ' (space char).  

```console
> python exec.py "Hello World!" | cat -e
!DLROw OLLEh$
> python exec.py "Hello" "my Friend" | cat -e
DNEIRf YM OLLEh$
> python exec.py
>
```
