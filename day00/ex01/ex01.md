You will have to make a program that reverses the order of a string and the case of its words.  
If we have more than one argument we have to merge them into a single string and sperate each arg by a ' ' (space char).  

```console
$> python exec.py "Hello World!" | cat -e
!DLROw OLLEh$
$> python exec.py "Hello" "my Friend" | cat -e
DNEIRf YM OLLEh$
$> python exec.py
$>
```
