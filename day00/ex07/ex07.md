You will have to make a program that removes all the words in a string that are shorter than or equal to n letters and returns the filtered list with no punctuation. For loops are forbidden.
The program will accept only two parameters: a string and n, an integer.

```console
$> python filterwords.py "Hello, my friend" 3
['Hello', 'friend']
$>  python filterwords.py "A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law" 6
['protect', 'existence', 'protection', 'conflict']
$> python filterwords.py Hello World
ERROR
$> python filterwords.py 300 3
ERROR
```
