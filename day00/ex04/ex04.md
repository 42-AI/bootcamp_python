You will have to make a program that prints the results of the four elementary mathematical operations of arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and the modulo operation. First, start by writing a function that takes 2 numbers as parameters and returns 5 values.

```console
$> python operations.py 10 3
Sum:         13
Difference:  7
Product:     30
Quotient:    3.3333333333333335
Remainder:   1
$> python operations.py 42 10
Sum:         52
Difference:  32
Product:     420
Quotient:    4.2
Remainder:   2
$> python operations.py
Usage: python operations.py <number1> <number2>
Example: python operations.py 10 3
```
