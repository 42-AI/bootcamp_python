We noticed that the students had trouble with the setup of their python path. You are going to master python path !

In order to have a simple life lets create a script the check if the right python version is installed and install it if it is not, you are going to use miniconda installer : .
You will also be able to install packages via `pip` using this script.

```console
$> ./installer.sh install-python
[v] python is installed.
$> ./installer.sh install-python
Python is already installed, do you want to reinstall it ?
[yes|no]> yes
[x] python has been removed.
[v] python is installed.
$> ./installer.sh install-python
Python is already installed, do you want to reinstall it ?
[yes|no]> no
exit.
```

The python folder will have to be installed in the `/goinfre` to save space on your session.
