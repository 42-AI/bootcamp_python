The first thing we need to do is install Python.

## Conda manual install

If you want a fully automated install go to Automated install part. The automated part will allow you to reinstall everything more easily if you change of Desktop. Here, we are going to see a step by step install.

1. Download conda install with the following command (MacOS version):

```bash
curl -LO "https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh"
```

2. Install conda using the script (we advise you to install it with this path `/goinfre/miniconda3`).

```bash
sh Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -b -p <path>
```

The goinfre will change depending on your desktop location in cluster, so you will need to reinstall everything.

3. Install needed requirements.

```bash
conda install -y "jupyter" "numpy" "pandas"
```

4. Add export to your `.zshrc` file.

```bash
export PATH=$MINICONDA_PATH:$PATH
```

5. Source your `.zshrc` file.

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

6. Check your Python environment.

```bash
which python
```

Your Python should now be the one corresponding to the miniconda environment! 

## Conda automated install 

A way to install the entire environment is to define a bash function in your `~/.zshrc`.

1. Copy paste the following code into your `~/.zshrc`.

```bash
function set_conda {
    HOME=$(echo ~)
    INSTALL_PATH="/goinfre"
    MINICONDA_PATH=$INSTALL_PATH"/miniconda3/bin"
    PYTHON_PATH=$(which python)
    SCRIPT="Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh"
    REQUIREMENTS="jupyter numpy pandas"
    DL_LINK="https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh"

    if echo $PYTHON_PATH | grep -q $INSTALL_PATH; then
	    echo "good python version :)"
    else
	cd
	if [ ! -f $SCRIPT ]; then
		curl -LO $DL_LINK
    	fi
    	if [ ! -d $MINICONDA_PATH ]; then
	    	sh $SCRIPT -b -p $INSTALL_PATH"/miniconda3"
	fi
	conda install -y $(echo $REQUIREMENTS)
	clear
	echo "Which python:"
	which python
	if grep -q "^export PATH=$MINICONDA_PATH" ~/.zshrc
	then
		echo "export already in .zshrc";
	else
		echo "adding export to .zshrc ...";
		echo "export PATH=$MINICONDA_PATH:\$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
	fi
	source ~/.zshrc
    fi
}
```

By default, conda will be installed in the goinfre (look at the `INSTALL_PATH` variable). Feel free to change that path if you want to.

The function can be used whenever we want and will carry out the installation of miniconda and all needed librairies for the day. It will also add a line to export miniconda environment.

2. Source your `.zshrc` with the following command:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

3. Use the function `set_conda`:

```bash
set_conda
```

When the installation is done rerun the `set_conda` function.

4. Check your Python path.

```bash
which python
```

Your Python should now be the one corresponding to the miniconda environment!

## Getting started

As an introduction, complete the following questionnaire using Python and `pip`, save your answers in a file `answers.txt` (write an answer per line in the text file), and check them with your peers.

Find the commands to:

1. Output a list of installed packages.

2. Output a list of installed packages and their versions.

3. Show the package metadata of `numpy`.

4. Search for PyPI packages whose name or summary contains "tesseract".

5. Freeze the packages and their current versions in a `requirements.txt` file you have to turn-in.
