We noticed that the students had trouble with the setup of their python path. You are going to master python path !  

In order to have a simple life lets create a script the check if the right python version is installed and install it if it is not, you are going to use miniconda installer : http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh to install python.  

Python is a binary that you can find in `/usr/local/bin` for example.  
When you enter `python` in your terminal it going to look in your $PATH var in the */bin folder for a python binary.  
The python that will be the chosen one would be the first python found in the `bin` dirs.  

When you are installing miniconda, you are going adding a new `bin` in the system with a python inside.  
To use this python you have 2 options : 
* use the absolut path `mypath/mydir/bin/python`.
* add the bin dir to your path var via `export PATH=mypath/mydir/bin:$PATH`.


```console
$> ./installer.sh install-python
Python has been installed.
$> ./installer.sh install-python
Python is already installed, do you want to reinstall it ?
[yes|no]> yes
Python has been removed.
Python has been installed.
$> python -V
Python 3.7.*
$> ./installer.sh install-python
Python is already installed, do you want to reinstall it ?
[yes|no]> no
exit.
```

The python folder will have to be installed in the `/goinfre` to save space on your session.

WARNING: Do not install python using brew on 42's computers, it will overload your session.
