Create a function called `text_analyzer` that displays the sums of upper-case characters, lower-case characters, punctuation characters and spaces in a given text.

`text_analyzer` will take only one parameter: the text to analyze. You have to handle the case where the text is empty (maybe by setting a default value). If there is no text passed to the function, the user is prompted to give one.

Test it in the Python console:

```console
> python
>>> from count import text_analyzer
>>> text_analyzer("Python 2.0, released 2000, introduced 
features like List comprehensions and a garbage collection
system capable of collecting reference cycles.")
The text contains 143 characters:
- 2 upper letters
- 113 lower letters
- 4 punctuation marks
- 18 spaces
>>> text_analyzer("Python is an interpreted, high-level,
general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van
Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy
emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant
whitespace.")
The text contains 234 characters:
- 5 upper letters
- 187 lower letters
- 8 punctuation marks
- 30 spaces
>>> text_analyzer()
What is the text to analyse?
>> Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose
programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first
released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code
readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
The text contains 234 characters:
- 5 upper letters
- 187 lower letters
- 8 punctuation marks
- 30 spaces
```

Handle the case when more than one parameter is given to `text_analyzer`:

```console
>>> from count import text_analyzer
>>> text_analyzer("Python", "2.0")
ERROR
```

You're free to write your docstring and format it the way you want.

```console
>>> print(text_analyzer.__doc__)

    This function counts the number of upper characters, lower characters,
    punctuation and spaces in a given text.
```
