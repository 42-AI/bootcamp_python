## Part 1: text_analyzer
Create a function called `text_analyzer` that takes a single string argument and displays the sums of its upper-case characters, lower-case characters, punctuation characters and spaces.

- If nothing is provided as argument, the user is prompted to provide a string (*you may need an adapted default value to handle this case*).

- If the argument is not a string, print an error message.

- This function must have a docstring that explains its behavior.

Use the Python console to test your function.

**Example:**

```console
> python3
>>> from count import text_analyzer
>>> text_analyzer("Python 2.0, released 2000, introduced
features like List comprehensions and a garbage collection
system capable of collecting reference cycles.")
The text contains 143 character(s):
- 2 upper letter(s)
- 113 lower letter(s)
- 4 punctuation mark(s)
- 18 space(s)
>>> text_analyzer("Python is an interpreted, high-level,
general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van
Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy
emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant
whitespace.")
The text contains 234 character(s):
- 5 upper letter(s)
- 187 lower letter(s)
- 8 punctuation mark(s)
- 30 space(s)
>>> text_analyzer()
What is the text to analyze?
>> Hello World!
The text contains 8 character(s):
- 2 upper letter(s)
- 8 lower letter(s)
- 1 punctuation mark(s)
- 1 space(s)
>>> text_analyzer(1)
ERROR
>>> text_analyzer(['Hello'])
ERROR
>>> print(text_analyzer.__doc__)

    This function counts the number of upper characters, lower characters,
    punctuation and spaces in a given text.
```


## Part 2: \_\_name\_\_ == \_\_main\_\_

In the previous part, you wrote a function that can be imported. Without modifying this function or behavior, update your file so it can be launched as a standalone program.

- If more than one argument is provided to this program, print an error message.

- Otherwise, use the `text_analyzer` function.

**Example:**


```console
> python3 count.py 'Hello World!'
The text contains 8 character(s):
- 2 upper letter(s)
- 8 lower letter(s)
- 1 punctuation mark(s)
- 1 space(s)
> python3
>>> from count import text_analyzer
>>> text_analyzer("Hello World!")
The text contains 8 character(s):
- 2 upper letter(s)
- 8 lower letter(s)
- 1 punctuation mark(s)
- 1 space(s)
```
