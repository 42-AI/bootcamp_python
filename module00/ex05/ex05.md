Let's get familiar with the useful concept of **string formatting** through a kata series.

Each exercice will provide you with a `kata` variable. This variable can be modified to a certain extent: your program must react accordingly.


## kata00

```python
# Put this at the top of your kata00.py file
kata = (19,42,21)
```

The `kata` variable is always a tuple and can only be filled with integer.

Write a program that display this variable content according to the format shown below:


```console
> python3 kata00.py
The 3 numbers are: 19, 42, 21
>
```

## kata01

``` python
# Put this at the top of your kata01.py file
kata = {
    'Python': 'Guido van Rossum',
    'Ruby': 'Yukihiro Matsumoto',
    'PHP': 'Rasmus Lerdorf',
    }
```

The `kata` variable is always a dictionary and can only be filled with strings.

Write a program that display this variable content according to the format shown below:

```console
> python3 kata01.py
Python was created by Guido van Rossum
Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto
PHP was created by Rasmus Lerdorf
>
```

## kata02

``` python
# Put this at the top of your kata02.py file
kata = (2019, 9, 25, 3, 30)
```

The `kata` variable is always a tuple that contains 5 non-negative integers. The first integer contains up to 4 digits, the rest up to 2 digits.

Write a program that display this variable content according to the format shown below:


```console
> python3 kata02.py | cat -e
09/25/2019 03:30$
> python3 kata02.py | wc -c
17
>
```

## kata03

``` python
# Put this at the top of your kata03.py file
kata = "The right format"
```

The `kata` variable is always a string whose length is not higher than 42.

Write a program that display this variable content according to the format shown below:

```console
> python3 kata03.py | cat -e
--------------------------The right format%
> python3 kata03.py | wc -c
42
>
```

## kata04

``` python
# Put this at the top of your kata04.py file
kata = (0, 4, 132.42222, 10000, 12345.67)
```

The `kata` variable is always a tuple that contains, in the following order:
- 2 non-negative integer containing up to 2 digits.
- 1 decimal
- 1 integer
- 1 decimal

Write a program that display this variable content according to the format shown below:

```console
> python3 kata04.py
module_00, ex_04 : 132.42, 1.00e+04, 1.23e+04
> python3 kata04.py | cut -c 10,18
,:
```
