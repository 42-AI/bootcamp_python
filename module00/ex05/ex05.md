# Exercise 05 - The right format

|                         |                    |
| -----------------------:| ------------------ |
|   Turn-in directory:    |  ex05              |
|   Files to turn in:     |  kata00.py, kata01.py, kata02.py, kata03.py, kata04.py |
|   Forbidden functions:  |  None              |

Let's get familiar with the useful concept of **string formatting** through a kata series.

### kata00

```
t = (19,42,21)
```

Including the tuple above in your file, write a program that dynamically builds up a formatted string like the following:

```console
> python kata00.py
The 3 numbers are: 19, 42, 21
```

### kata01

```
languages = {
    'Python': 'Guido van Rossum',
    'Ruby': 'Yukihiro Matsumoto',
    'PHP': 'Rasmus Lerdorf',
    }
```

Using the `languages` dictionary above, a similar exercise:

```console
> python kata01.py
Python was created by Guido van Rossum
Ruby was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto
PHP was created by Rasmus Lerdorf
```

### kata02

```
(3,30,2019,9,25)
```

Given the tuple above, whose values stand for: `(hour, minutes, year, month, day)`, write a program that displays it in the following format:

```console
> python kata02.py
09/25/2019 03:30
```

### kata03

```
phrase = "The right format"
```

Write a program to display the string above right-aligned with '-' padding and a total length of 42 characters:

```console
> python kata03.py | cat -e
--------------------------The right format%
> python kata03.py | wc -c
    42
```

### kata04

```
( 0, 4, 132.42222, 10000, 12345.67)
```

Given the tuple above, return the following result:

```console
> python kata04.py
module_00, ex_04 : 132.42, 1.00e+04, 1.23e+04
```
