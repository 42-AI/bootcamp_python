You will have to make a program that prints the results of the four elementary mathematical operations of arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and the modulo operation. This should be accomplished by writing a function that takes 2 numbers as parameters and returns 5 values, as formatted in the console output below.

**Example:**

```console
> python operations.py 10 3
Sum:         13
Difference:  7
Product:     30
Quotient:    3.3333333333333335
Remainder:   1
>
> python operations.py 42 10
Sum:         52
Difference:  32
Product:     420
Quotient:    4.2
Remainder:   2
>
> python operations.py 1 0
Sum:         1
Difference:  1
Product:     0
Quotient:    ERROR (div by zero)
Remainder:   ERROR (modulo by zero)
>
> python operations.py
Usage: python operations.py <number1> <number2>
Example:
    python operations.py 10 3
>
> python operations.py 12 10 5
InputError: too many arguments

Usage: python operations.py <number1> <number2>
Example:
    python operations.py 10 3
>
> python operations.py "one" "two"
InputError: only numbers

Usage: python operations.py <number1> <number2>
Example:
    python operations.py 10 3
>
> python operations.py "512" "63.1"
InputError: only numbers

Usage: python operations.py <number1> <number2>
Example:
    python operations.py 10 3
```
