Make a program that takes a string S and an integer N as argument and prints the list of words in S that contains more than N non-punctuation characters.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Words are separated from each other by space characters
	\item Punctuation symbols must be removed from the printed list: they are neither part of a word nor a separator
	\item The program must contain at least one \textbf{list comprehension} expression. 
\end{itemize}
If the number of argument is different from 2, or if the type of any argument is invalid, the program prints an error message.
