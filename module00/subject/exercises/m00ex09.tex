You have to make a program that will be an interactive guessing game.\\
\newline
It will prompt the user to guess a number between $1$ and $99$. The program will tell the user if their 
input is too high or too low.
\newline
The game ends when the user finds out the secret number or types \texttt{exit}.\\
\newline
You will import the \texttt{random} module with the \texttt{randint} function to get a random number.
You have to count the number of trials and print that number when the user wins.
