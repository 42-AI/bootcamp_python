Make a program that takes a string as argument, reverses it, swaps its letters case and print the result.

If more than one argument are provided, merge them into a single string with each argument separated by a space character.

If no argument is provided, print nothing.

**Example:**

```console
> python3 exec.py 'Hello World!' | cat -e
!DLROw OLLEh$
> python3 exec.py 'Hello' 'my Friend' | cat -e
DNEIRf YM OLLEh$
> python3 exec.py
>
```
