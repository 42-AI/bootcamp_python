# Exercise 07 - Shorter, faster, pythonest

|                         |                    |
| -----------------------:| ------------------ |
|   Turn-in directory:    |  ex07/              |
|   Files to turn in:     |  filterwords.py    |
|   Forbidden functions:  |  filter            |
|   Remarks:              |  n/a               |

## Instructions:

Using list comprehensions, you have to make a program which removes all the words in a string that are shorter than or equal to n letters, and returns the filtered list with no punctuation.  
The program will accept only two parameters: a string, and an integer n.

## Examples:

```console
> python filterwords.py "Hello, my friend" 3
['Hello', 'friend']

>  python filterwords.py "A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law" 6
['protect', 'existence', 'protection', 'conflict']

> python filterwords.py Hello World
ERROR

> python filterwords.py 300 3
ERROR
```
