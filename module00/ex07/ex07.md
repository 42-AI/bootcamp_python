|   Turn-in directory:    |  ex07              |
|   Files to turn in:     |  filterwords.py    |
|   Forbidden functions:  |  filter            |

Make a program that takes a string `S` and an integer `N` as argument and print the list of words in `S` that contains more than `N` characters.


- Words are separated from each other by space characters
- Punctuations symbols are **not** part of a word and must be removed
- The program must contains at least one ***list comprehension*** expression

If 0, 1, 3 or more arguments are provided or if the type of any argument is wrong, print an error message.

**Example:**

```console
> python3 filterwords.py 'Hello, my friend' 3
['Hello', 'friend']
>  python3 filterwords.py 'A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law' 6
['protect', 'existence', 'protection', 'conflict']
> python3 filterwords.py Hello World
ERROR
> python3 filterwords.py 3 'Hello, my friend'
ERROR
> python3 filterwords.py
ERROR
```
