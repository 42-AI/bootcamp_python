Make a program that takes a string as argument and encode it into Morse code.

- A character is represented by dots `.` and dashes `-`
- To separate characters, use a single space
- To represent a space between words, use a slash `/`
- The program only support space and alphanumeric characters

If more than one argument are provided, merge them into a single string with each argument separated by a space character.

If no argument is provided, print nothing.

**Example:**

```console
> python3 sos.py "SOS"
... --- ...
> python3 sos.py
> python3 sos.py "HELLO / WORLD"
ERROR
> python3 sos.py "96 BOULEVARD" "Bessiere"
----. -.... / -... --- ..- .-.. . ...- .- .-. -.. / -... . ... ... .. . .-. .
```
