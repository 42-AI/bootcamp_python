<!--***Hints:*** check what is a nested dictionary in Python.
-->

## Part 1: Nested dictionary
Create a dictionary called ***cookbook***. You will use this ***cookbook*** to store recipe.

A recipe is a **dictionary** that stores 3 couples key-value:
* "ingredients": a **list of string** representing the list of ingredients
* "meal": a **string** representing the type of meal
* "prep_time": a **non-negative integer** representing a time in minutes

In the ***cookbook***, the **key** to a recipe is the recipe name.

Initialize your ***cookbook*** with 3 recipes:
* "Sandwich": "Composed of *ham*, *bread*, *cheese* and *tomatoes*. It is a *lunch* and it takes *10* minutes of preparation.  
* "Cake": Composed of *flour*, *sugar* and *eggs*. It is a *dessert* and it takes *60* minutes of preparation.  
* "Salad": Composed of *avocado*, *arugula*, *tomatoes* and *spinach*. It is a *lunch* and it takes *15* minutes of preparation.  

## Part 2: helpful functions & user input

We will now create a series of useful function to handle our ***cookbook***.

1. Create a function that print all recipe names from ***cookbook***.

2. Create a function that take a recipe name as argument and print its details from ***cookbook***.

3. Create a function that take a recipe name as argument and delete it from ***cookbook***.

4. Create a function that add a recipe in the ***cookbook*** from user `input`. You need a recipe name, an ingredient list, a meal type and a preparation time. 

Example:
```
>>> Choose a name:
chips
>>> Choose ingredients:
potatoes
oil
salt

>>> Choose a type:
lunch
>>> Choose a preparation time:
15
```

## Part 3: Command line executable

Create a program that use your ***cookbook*** and your functions.

The program will prompt the user to make a choice between printing the cookbook content, printing one recipe, adding a recipe, deleting a recipe or quitting the cookbook.

Your program will continue to ask for prompt until the user decide to quit it. The program cannot crash if a wrong value is entered: you must handle the error and ask for another prompt.

Example:

```console
> python recipe.py
