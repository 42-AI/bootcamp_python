# Exercise 00 - $PATH

|   Files to turn in:     |  answers.txt, requirements.txt |

The first thing you need is a proper working environment.

Most modern Unix-based system have a `python` interpreter installed by default, but its version might be lower/higher than the one used for these modules. It is also possible that the default `python` command uses a version 2.x (*for legacy reasons*). This is obviously very confusing for new developper.

```bash
$> python -V
$> python3 -V
```

To deal with those version issues we will use `conda`. This program allow you to manage your Python package and different working environments.

*Note: the actual requirement is to use a Python 3.7.X version. You are free to use a different program/utilities to achieve this goal. At your own risk.*


## Conda manual install

We recommend the following path for your `conda` folder.

``` bash
MYPATH="/goinfre/$USER/miniconda3"
```

**1. Download & Install conda**

```bash
# For MAC
curl -LO "https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh"
sh Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -b -p $MYPATH

# For Linux
curl -LO "https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh"
sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p $MYPATH
```

**2. Initial configuration of conda**


```bash
# For zsh
$MYPATH/bin/conda init zsh
$MYPATH/bin/conda config --set auto_activate_base false
source ~/.zshrc

# For bash
$MYPATH/bin/conda init bash
$MYPATH/bin/conda config --set auto_activate_base false
source ~/.bash_profile
```

**3. Create an environment for 42AI !**


```bash
conda create --name 42AI-$USER python=3.7 jupyter numpy pandas pycodestyle
```

**4. Check your 42AI Python environment**

```bash
conda info --envs
conda activate 42AI-$USER
which python
python -V
python -c "print('Hello World!')"
conda deactivate
```

### Help !
- I have lost my miniconda3 folder !

  Repeat step 1 and 3.

- I have lost my home directory !

  Repeat step 2.


## Getting started

As an introduction, complete the following questionnaire using Python and `pip`, save your answers in a file `answers.txt` (write an answer per line in the text file), and check them with your peers.

Find the commands to:

1. Output a list of installed packages and their versions.

2. Show the package metadata of `numpy`.

3. Search for PyPI packages whose name or summary contains "tesseract".

4. Freeze the packages and their current versions in a `requirements.txt` file you have to turn-in.
